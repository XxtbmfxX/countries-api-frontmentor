## The challenge

[REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2)

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

- Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
